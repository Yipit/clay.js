# What

Clay is a lightweight active record for Node.js applications.  It
leverages the effort of declaring models and its relationships, and
store them in any backend.

Clay comes with builtin support for [Redis](http://redis.io) but has a
very simple interface with storage mechanisms, so that you can write
your own backend.

# Hands On !

## installation

```bash
npm install clay
```

## declaration

the example below was extracted from
[emerald](http://github.com/Yipit/emerald)'s codebase

```javascript
var redis = require('redis').createConnection();
var models = require('clay');

var User = models.declare("User", function(it, kind){
    it.has.field("name", kind.string);
    it.has.field("email", kind.email);
    it.has.field("password", kind.hashOf(["name", "email"]));
    it.has.method('greet', function() {
        return [
            "Hello, my name is ", this.name, ", it's nice to meet you"
        ].join('');
    });
});

var Build = models.declare("Build", function(it, kind){
    it.has.field("status", kind.numeric);
    it.has.field("error", kind.string);
    it.has.field("output", kind.string);
});
var BuildInstruction = models.declare("BuildInstruction", function(it, kind){
    it.has.field("name", kind.string);
    it.has.field("repository_address", kind.string);
    it.has.field("build_command", kind.string);
    it.validates.uniquenessOf("name");
    it.has.index("repository_address");
    it.has.many("builds", Build, "instruction");
    it.has.one("owner", User, "created_instructions");
});

var lettuce_instructions = new BuildInstruction({
    name: 'Lettuce Unit Tests',
    repository_address: 'git://github.com/gabrielfalcao/lettuce.git',
    build_command: 'make unit'
});

lettuce_instructions.save(function(err, pk, model_instance, storage, redis_connection){
    assert.equal(pk, 'clay:BuildInstruction:id:1')
});
```
